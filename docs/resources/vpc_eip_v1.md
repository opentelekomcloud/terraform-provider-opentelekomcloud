# opentelekomcloud_vpc_eip_v1

Manages a V1 EIP resource within OpenTelekomCloud VPC.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "opentelekomcloud_vpc_eip_v1" "eip_1" {
  publicip {
    type = "5_bgp"
  }
  bandwidth {
    name        = "test"
    size        = 8
    share_type  = "PER"
    charge_mode = "traffic"
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `region` - (Optional) The region in which to obtain the V1 Networking client.
  If omitted, the `region` argument of the provider is used. Changing this
  creates a new service.

* `publicip` - (Required) The elastic IP address object.

* `bandwidth` - (Required) The bandwidth object.

The `publicip` block supports:

* `type` - (Required) The value must be a type supported by [the system](https://docs.otc.t-systems.com/api/eip/eip_api_0001.html#eip_api_0001__en-us_topic_0201534274_table4491214).
  The value can be `5_bgp`, `5_mailbgp` and `5_gray`. Changing this creates a new eip.

* `ip_address` - (Optional) The value must be a valid IP address in the available
  IP address segment. Changing this creates a new eip.

* `port_id` - (Optional) The port id which this eip will associate with. If the value
  is `""` or this not specified, the eip will be in unbind state.

The `bandwidth` block supports:

* `name` - (Required) The bandwidth name, which is a string of 1 to 64 characters
  that contain letters, digits, underscores (_), and hyphens (-).

* `size` - (Required) The bandwidth size. The value ranges from 1 to 300 Mbit/s.

* `share_type` - (Required) Whether the bandwidth is shared or exclusive. Changing
  this creates a new eip.

* `charge_mode` - (Optional) This is a reserved field. If the system supports charging
  by traffic and this field is specified, then you are charged by traffic for elastic
  IP addresses. Changing this creates a new eip.

* `tags` - (Optional) Tags key/value pairs to associate with the eip.

* `unbind_port` - (Optional) The value `true` indicates that port will be unassigned from EIP.
  This parameter work only with already allocated resource.
