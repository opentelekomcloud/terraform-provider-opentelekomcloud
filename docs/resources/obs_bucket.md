# opentelekomcloud_obs_bucket

Provides an OBS bucket resource within OpenTelekomCloud.

## Example Usage

### Private Bucket with Tags

```hcl
resource "opentelekomcloud_obs_bucket" "b" {
  bucket = "my-tf-test-bucket"
  acl    = "private"

  tags = {
    foo = "bar"
    Env = "Test"
  }
}
```

### Enable versioning

```hcl
resource "opentelekomcloud_obs_bucket" "b" {
  bucket     = "my-tf-test-bucket"
  acl        = "private"
  versioning = true
}
```

### Suspend versioning

```hcl
resource "opentelekomcloud_obs_bucket" "b" {
  bucket     = "my-tf-test-bucket"
  acl        = "private"
  versioning = false
}
```

### Enable Logging

```hcl
resource "opentelekomcloud_obs_bucket" "log_bucket" {
  bucket = "my-tf-log-bucket"
  acl    = "log-delivery-write"
}

resource "opentelekomcloud_obs_bucket" "b" {
  bucket = "my-tf-test-bucket"
  acl    = "private"

  logging {
    target_bucket = opentelekomcloud_obs_bucket.log_bucket.id
    target_prefix = "log/"
  }
}
```

### Static Website Hosting

```hcl
resource "opentelekomcloud_obs_bucket" "b" {
  bucket = "obs-website-test.hashicorp.com"
  acl    = "public-read"

  website {
    index_document = "index.html"
    error_document = "error.html"

    routing_rules = <<EOF
[{
    "Condition": {
        "KeyPrefixEquals": "docs/"
    },
    "Redirect": {
        "ReplaceKeyPrefixWith": "documents/"
    }
}]
EOF
  }
}
```

### Using CORS

```hcl
resource "opentelekomcloud_obs_bucket" "b" {
  bucket = "obs-website-test.hashicorp.com"
  acl    = "public-read"

  cors_rule {
    allowed_origins = ["https://obs-website-test.hashicorp.com"]
    allowed_methods = ["PUT", "POST"]
    allowed_headers = ["*"]
    expose_headers  = ["ETag"]
    max_age_seconds = 3000
  }
}
```

### Using server side encryption for the bucket

```hcl
resource "opentelekomcloud_obs_bucket" "bucket" {
  bucket        = "my-bucket"
  storage_class = "WARM"
  acl           = "public-read"

  server_side_encryption {
    algorithm  = "kms"
    kms_key_id = var.kms_master_key_id
  }
}
```

### Using object lifecycle

```hcl
resource "opentelekomcloud_obs_bucket" "bucket" {
  bucket     = "my-bucket"
  acl        = "private"
  versioning = true

  lifecycle_rule {
    name    = "log"
    prefix  = "log/"
    enabled = true

    expiration {
      days = 365
    }
    transition {
      days          = 60
      storage_class = "WARM"
    }
    transition {
      days          = 180
      storage_class = "COLD"
    }
  }

  lifecycle_rule {
    name    = "tmp"
    prefix  = "tmp/"
    enabled = true

    noncurrent_version_expiration {
      days = 180
    }
    noncurrent_version_transition {
      days          = 30
      storage_class = "WARM"
    }
    noncurrent_version_transition {
      days          = 60
      storage_class = "COLD"
    }
  }
}
```

### Using event notifications

```hcl
resource "opentelekomcloud_smn_topic_v2" "topic" {
  name         = "obs-notifications"
  display_name = "The display name of topic_1"
}

resource "opentelekomcloud_smn_topic_attribute_v2" "policy" {
  topic_urn       = opentelekomcloud_smn_topic_v2.topic.id
  attribute_name  = "access_policy"
  topic_attribute = <<EOF
{
  "Version": "2016-09-07",
  "Id": "__default_policy_ID",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "__service_pub_0",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Service": [
          "obs",
          "s3"
        ]
      },
      "Action": [
        "SMN:Publish",
        "SMN:QueryTopicDetail"
      ],
      "Resource": "${opentelekomcloud_smn_topic_v2.topic.id}"
    }
  ]
}
EOF

}

resource "opentelekomcloud_obs_bucket" "bucket" {
  bucket = "tf-test-bucket-%[1]d"
  acl    = "private"

  event_notifications {
    topic = opentelekomcloud_smn_topic_v2.topic.id
    events = [
      "ObjectCreated:*",
      "ObjectRemoved:*",
    ]
    filter_rule {
      name  = "prefix"
      value = "smn"
    }
    filter_rule {
      name  = "suffix"
      value = ".jpg"
    }
  }

  depends_on = [opentelekomcloud_smn_topic_attribute_v2.policy]
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `bucket` - (Required) Specifies the name of the bucket. Changing this parameter will create a new resource.
  A bucket must be named according to the globally applied DNS naming regulations as follows:
  * The name must be globally unique in OBS.
  * The name must contain 3 to 63 characters. Only lowercase letters, digits, hyphens (-), and periods (.) are allowed.
  * The name cannot start or end with a period (.) or hyphen (-), and cannot contain two consecutive periods (.)
    or contain a period (.) and a hyphen (-) adjacent to each other.
  * The name cannot be an IP address.
  * If the name contains any periods (.), a security certificate verification message may appear when you access
    the bucket or its objects by entering a domain name.

* `storage_class` - (Optional) Specifies the storage class of the bucket. OBS provides three storage classes:
  `STANDARD`, `WARM` (Infrequent Access) and `COLD` (Archive). Defaults to `STANDARD`.

* `acl` - (Optional) Specifies the ACL policy for a bucket. The predefined common policies are as follows:
  `private`, `public-read`, `public-read-write` and `log-delivery-write`. Defaults to `private`.

* `tags` - (Optional) A mapping of tags to assign to the bucket. Each tag is represented by one key-value pair.

* `versioning` - (Optional) Set to `true` to enable versioning. Once you version-enable a bucket, it can never return to an
  unversioned state. You can, however, suspend versioning on that bucket. If omitted, during bucket
  creation it will be in `Disabled` state.

* `logging` - (Optional) A settings of bucket logging (documented below).

* `website` - (Optional) A website object (documented below).
