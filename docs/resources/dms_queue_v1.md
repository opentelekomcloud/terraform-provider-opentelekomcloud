Manages a DMS queue in the OpenTelekomCloud DMS Service.

## Example Usage

### Automatically detect the correct network

```hcl
resource "opentelekomcloud_dms_queue_v1" "queue_1" {
  name              = "queue_1"
  description       = "test create dms queue"
  queue_mode        = "FIFO"
  redrive_policy    = "enable"
  max_consume_count = 80
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) Indicates the unique name of a queue. A string of 1 to 64
  characters that contain a-z, A-Z, 0-9, hyphens (-), and underscores (_).
  The name cannot be modified once specified.

* `queue_mode` - (Optional) Indicates the queue type. It only support 'NORMAL' and 'FIFO'.
  NORMAL: Standard queue. Best-effort ordering. Messages might be retrieved in an order
  different from which they were sent. Select standard queues when throughput is important.
  FIFO: First-ln-First-out (FIFO) queue. FIFO delivery. Messages are retrieved in the
  order they were sent. Select FIFO queues when the order of messages is important.
  Default value: NORMAL.

* `description` - (Optional) Indicates the basic information about a queue. The queue
  description must be 0 to 160 characters in length, and does not contain angle
  brackets (<) and (>).

* `redrive_policy` - (Optional) Indicates whether to enable dead letter messages.
  Dead letter messages indicate messages that cannot be normally consumed.
  The redrive_policy should be set to 'enable' or 'disable'. The default value is 'disable'.

* `max_consume_count` - (Optional) This parameter is mandatory only when redrive_policy is
  set to enable. This parameter indicates the maximum number of allowed message consumption
  failures. When a message fails to be consumed after the number of consumption attempts of
  this message reaches this value, DMS stores this message into the dead letter queue.
  The max_consume_count value range is 1â€“100.
