# opentelekomcloud_networking_floatingip_v2

Manages a V2 floating IP resource within OpenTelekomCloud.

## Example Usage

resource "opentelekomcloud_networking_floatingip_v2" "floatip_1" {}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `pool` - (Optional) The name of the pool from which to obtain the floating
  IP. Default value is `admin_external_net`. Changing this creates a new floating IP.

  associate with this floating IP.

* `tenant_id` - (Optional) The target tenant ID in which to allocate the floating
  IP, if you specify this together with a `port_id`, make sure the target port
  belongs to the same tenant. Changing this creates a new floating IP (which
  may or may not have a different address).

* `fixed_ip` - Fixed IP of the port to associate with this floating IP. Required if
  the port has multiple fixed IPs.

* `value_specs` - (Optional) Map of additional options.

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `pool` - See Argument Reference above.

* `address` - The actual floating IP address itself.

* `port_id` - ID of associated port.

* `tenant_id` - the ID of the tenant in which to create the floating IP.

* `fixed_ip` - The fixed IP which the floating IP maps to.
