# opentelekomcloud_identity_password_policy_v3

Manages the IAM account password policy within OpenTelekomCloud.

`Please use it with care!`
-> You _must_ have security admin privileges in your OpenTelekomCloud
cloud to use this resource. Please refer to [User Management Model](https://docs.otc.t-systems.com/en-us/usermanual/iam/iam_01_0034.html).

  During action `terraform destroy` it sets values the same as defaults for this resource.
  Defaults is:
  +  `maximum_consecutive_identical_chars` = 0
  +  `minimum_password_length` = 8
  +  `minimum_password_age` = 0
  +  `number_of_recent_passwords_disallowed` = 1
  +  `password_not_username_or_invert` = true
  +  `password_validity_period` = 0

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "opentelekomcloud_identity_password_policy_v3" "policy_1" {
  maximum_consecutive_identical_chars   = 0
  minimum_password_length               = 6
  minimum_password_age                  = 0
  number_of_recent_passwords_disallowed = 0
  password_not_username_or_invert       = true
  password_validity_period              = 179
}
```
