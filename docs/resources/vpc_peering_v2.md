# opentelekomcloud_vpc_peering_connection_v2

Provides a resource to manage a VPC Peering Connection resource within OpenTelekomCloud.

-> **Note:** For cross-tenant (requester's tenant differs from the accepter's tenant) VPC Peering Connections, use the `opentelekomcloud_vpc_peering_connection_v2` resource to manage the requester's side of the connection and use the `opentelekomcloud_vpc_peering_connection_accepter_v2` resource to manage the accepter's side of the connection.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "opentelekomcloud_vpc_peering_connection_v2" "peering" {
  name        = var.peer_conn_name
  vpc_id      = var.vpc_id
  peer_vpc_id = var.accepter_vpc_id
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) Specifies the name of the VPC peering connection. The value can contain 1 to 64 characters.

* `vpc_id` - (Required) Specifies the ID of a VPC involved in a VPC peering connection. Changing this creates a new VPC peering connection.

* `peer_vpc_id` - (Required) Specifies the VPC ID of the accepter tenant. Changing this creates a new VPC peering connection.

* `peer_tenant_id` - (Optional) Specified the Tenant Id of the accepter tenant. Changing this creates a new VPC peering connection.

## Attributes Reference

All of the argument attributes are also exported as result attributes:

* `id` - The VPC peering connection ID.

* `status` - The VPC peering connection status. The value can be `PENDING_ACCEPTANCE`, `REJECTED`, `EXPIRED`, `DELETED`, or `ACTIVE`.

-> **Note:** If you create a VPC peering connection with another VPC of your own, the connection is created without the need for you to accept the connection.

## Import

VPC Peering resources can be imported using the `vpc peering id`, e.g.

```sh
terraform import opentelekomcloud_vpc_peering_connection_v2.test_connection 22b76469-08e3-4937-8c1d-7aad34892be1
```
