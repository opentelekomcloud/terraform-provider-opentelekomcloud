# opentelekomcloud_mrs_job_v1

Manages resource job within OpenTelekomCloud MRS.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "opentelekomcloud_mrs_job_v1" "job1" {
  job_type   = 1
  job_name   = "test_mapreduce_job1"
  cluster_id = "ef43d2ff-1ecf-4f13-bd0c-0004c429a058"
  jar_path   = "s3a://wordcount/program/hadoop-mapreduce-examples-2.7.5.jar"
  input      = "s3a://wordcount/input/"
  output     = "s3a://wordcount/output/"
  job_log    = "s3a://wordcount/log/"
  arguments  = "wordcount"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `job_type` - (Required) Job type
  * 1: MapReduce
  * 2: Spark
  * 3: Hive Script
  * 4: HiveQL (not supported currently)
  * 5: DistCp, importing and exporting data.
  * 6: Spark Script
  * 7: Spark SQL, submitting Spark SQL statements. (not supported in this  API currently)

-> **Note:** Spark and Hive jobs can be added to only clusters including Spark and Hive components.

* `job_name` - (Required) Job name Contains only 1 to 64 letters, digits, hyphens
  (-), and underscores (_).

-> **Note:** Identical job names are allowed but not recommended.

* `cluster_id` - (Required) Cluster ID

* `jar_path` - (Required) Path of the .jar package or .sql file for program
  execution The parameter must meet the following requirements: Contains a maximum
  of 1023 characters, excluding special characters such as ;|&><'$. The address
  cannot be empty or full of spaces. Starts with / or s3a://. Spark Script must
  end with .sql; while MapReduce and Spark Jar must end with .jar. sql and jar
  are case-insensitive.

* `arguments` - (Optional) Key parameter for program execution. The parameter
  is specified by the function of the user's program. MRS is only responsible
  for loading the parameter. The parameter contains a maximum of 2047 characters,
  excluding special characters such as ;|&>'<$, and can be empty.

* `input` - (Optional) Path for inputting data, which must start with / or s3a://.

  automatically creates it. The parameter contains a maximum of 1023 characters,
  excluding special characters such as ;|&>'<$, and can be empty.

* `job_log` - (Optional) Path for storing job logs that record job running status.
  This path must start with / or s3a://. A correct OBS path is required. The parameter
  contains a maximum of 1023 characters, excluding special characters such as
  ;|&>'<$, and can be empty.

* `hive_script_path` - (Optional) SQL program path This parameter is needed
  by Spark Script and Hive Script jobs only and must meet the following requirements:
  Contains a maximum of 1023 characters, excluding special characters such as
  ;|&><'$. The address cannot be empty or full of spaces. Starts with / or s3a://.
  Ends with .sql. sql is case-insensitive.

* `is_protected` - (Optional) Whether a job is protected true false The current
  version does not support this function.

* `is_public` - (Optional) Whether a job is public true false The current version
  does not support this function.
