# opentelekomcloud_elb_health

Manages a classic loadbalancer health resource within OpenTelekomCloud.

~>
Classic load balancers are no longer provided. Please use elastic load balancers instead.
This resource was replaced with `opentelekomcloud_lb_monitor_v2`.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "opentelekomcloud_elb_loadbalancer" "elb" {
  name           = "elb"
  type           = "External"
  description    = "test elb"
  vpc_id         = "e346dc4a-d9a6-46f4-90df-10153626076e"
  admin_state_up = "true"
  bandwidth      = 5
}

resource "opentelekomcloud_elb_listener" "listener" {
  name             = "test-elb-listener"
  description      = "great listener"
  protocol         = "TCP"
  backend_protocol = "TCP"
  protocol_port    = 12345
  backend_port     = 8080
  lb_algorithm     = "roundrobin"
  loadbalancer_id  = opentelekomcloud_elb_loadbalancer.elb.id
  timeouts {
    create = "5m"
    update = "5m"
    delete = "5m"
  }
}

resource "opentelekomcloud_elb_health" "healthcheck" {
  listener_id              = opentelekomcloud_elb_listener.listener.id
  healthcheck_protocol     = "TCP"
  healthcheck_connect_port = 22
  healthy_threshold        = 5
  healthcheck_timeout      = 25
  healthcheck_interval     = 3

  timeouts {
    create = "5m"
    update = "5m"
    delete = "5m"
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `listener_id` - (Required) Specifies the ID of the listener to which the health
  check task belongs. Changing this creates a new elb health.

* `healthcheck_protocol` - (Optional) Specifies the protocol used for the health
  check. The value can be HTTP or TCP (case-insensitive).

* `healthcheck_uri` - (Optional) Specifies the URI for health check. This parameter
  is valid when healthcheck_ protocol is HTTP. The value is a string of 1 to 80
  characters that must start with a slash (/) and can only contain letters, digits,
  and special characters, such as -/.%?#&.

* `healthcheck_connect_port` - (Optional) Specifies the port used for the health
  check. The value ranges from 1 to 65535.

* `healthy_threshold` - (Optional) Specifies the threshold at which the health
  check result is success, that is, the number of consecutive successful health
  checks when the health check result of the backend server changes from fail
  to success. The value ranges from 1 to 10.

* `unhealthy_threshold` - (Optional) Specifies the threshold at which the health
  check result is fail, that is, the number of consecutive failed health checks
  when the health check result of the backend server changes from success to fail.
  The value ranges from 1 to 10.

* `healthcheck_timeout` - (Optional) Specifies the maximum timeout duration
  (s) for the health check. The value ranges from 1 to 50.

* `healthcheck_interval` - (Optional) Specifies the maximum interval (s) for
  health check. The value ranges from 1 to 5.
