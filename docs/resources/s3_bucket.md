# opentelekomcloud_s3_bucket

Provides a S3 bucket resource within OpenTelekomCloud.

## Example Usage

### Private Bucket w/ Tags

```hcl
resource "opentelekomcloud_s3_bucket" "bucket" {
  bucket = "my-tf-test-bucket"
  acl    = "private"

  tags = {
    Name        = "My bucket"
    Environment = "Dev"
  }
}
```

### Static Website Hosting

```hcl
resource "opentelekomcloud_s3_bucket" "bucket" {
  bucket = "s3-website-test.hashicorp.com"
  acl    = "public-read"
  policy = file("policy.json")
  website {
    index_document = "index.html"
    error_document = "error.html"

    routing_rules = <<EOF
[{
    "Condition": {
        "KeyPrefixEquals": "docs/"
    },
    "Redirect": {
        "ReplaceKeyPrefixWith": "documents/"
    }
}]
EOF
  }
}
```

### Using CORS

```hcl
resource "opentelekomcloud_s3_bucket" "bucket" {
  bucket = "s3-website-test.hashicorp.com"
  acl    = "public-read"

  cors_rule {
    allowed_headers = ["*"]
    allowed_methods = ["PUT", "POST"]
    allowed_origins = ["https://s3-website-test.hashicorp.com"]
    expose_headers  = ["ETag"]
    max_age_seconds = 3000
  }
}
```

### Using versioning

```hcl
resource "opentelekomcloud_s3_bucket" "bucket" {
  bucket = "my-tf-test-bucket"
  acl    = "private"

  versioning {
    enabled = true
  }
}
```

### Enable Logging

```hcl
resource "opentelekomcloud_s3_bucket" "log_bucket" {
  bucket = "my-tf-log-bucket"
  acl    = "log-delivery-write"
}

resource "opentelekomcloud_s3_bucket" "b" {
  bucket = "my-tf-test-bucket"
  acl    = "private"

  logging {
    target_bucket = opentelekomcloud_s3_bucket.log_bucket.id
    target_prefix = "log/"
  }
}
```

### Using object lifecycle

```hcl
resource "opentelekomcloud_s3_bucket" "bucket" {
  bucket = "my-bucket"
  acl    = "private"

  lifecycle_rule {
    id      = "log"
    enabled = true

    prefix = "log/"
    expiration {
      days = 90
    }
  }

  lifecycle_rule {
    id      = "tmp"
    prefix  = "tmp/"
    enabled = true

    expiration {
      date = "2016-01-12"
    }
  }
}

resource "opentelekomcloud_s3_bucket" "versioning_bucket" {
  bucket = "my-versioning-bucket"
  acl    = "private"

  versioning {
    enabled = true
  }

  lifecycle_rule {
    prefix  = "config/"
    enabled = true
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `bucket` - (Optional, Forces new resource) The name of the bucket. If omitted, Terraform will assign a
  random, unique name.

* `bucket_prefix` - (Optional, Forces new resource) Creates a unique bucket name beginning with the specified prefix.
  Conflicts with `bucket`.

* `acl` - (Optional) The [canned ACL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#canned-acl)
  to apply. Defaults to `private`.

* `policy` - (Optional) A valid [bucket policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/example-bucket-policies.html)
  JSON document.

-> If the policy document is not specific enough (but still valid), Terraform may view the policy as constantly
changing in a `terraform plan`. In this case, please make sure you use the verbose/specific version of the policy.

* `tags` - (Optional) A mapping of tags to assign to the bucket.

* `force_destroy` - (Optional, Default:false) A boolean that indicates all objects should be deleted from the bucket
  so that the bucket can be destroyed without error. These objects are *not* recoverable.

* `website` - (Optional) A website object (documented below).

* `cors_rule` - (Optional) A rule of [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/cors.html) (documented below).

* `versioning` - (Optional) A state of [versioning](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/Versioning.html) (documented below)

* `logging` - (Optional) A settings of [bucket logging](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/UG/ManagingBucketLogging.html) (documented below).

* `lifecycle_rule` - (Optional) A configuration of [object lifecycle management](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-lifecycle-mgmt.html)
  (documented below). The `website` object supports the following:

* `index_document` - (Required, unless using `redirect_all_requests_to`) Amazon S3 returns this index document when
  requests are made to the root domain or any of the subfolders.

* `error_document` - (Optional) An absolute path to the document to return in case of a 4XX error.

* `redirect_all_requests_to` - (Optional) A hostname to redirect all website requests for this bucket to.
  Hostname can optionally be prefixed with a protocol (`http://` or `https://`) to use when redirecting
  requests. The default is the protocol that is used in the original request.

* `routing_rules` - (Optional) A json array containing [routing rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-s3-websiteconfiguration-routingrules.html)
  describing redirect behavior and when redirects are applied.

The `cors_rule` object supports the following:

* `allowed_headers` - (Optional) Specifies which headers are allowed.

* `allowed_methods` - (Required) Specifies which methods are allowed. Can be `GET`, `PUT`, `POST`, `DELETE` or `HEAD`.

* `allowed_origins` - (Required) Specifies which origins are allowed.

* `expose_headers` - (Optional) Specifies expose header in the response.

* `max_age_seconds` - (Optional) Specifies time in seconds that browser can cache the response for a preflight request.

The `versioning` object supports the following:

* `enabled` - (Optional) Enable versioning. Once you version-enable a bucket, it can never return to an unversioned state.
  You can, however, suspend versioning on that bucket. If omitted, during bucket creation it will be in `Disabled` state.

* `mfa_delete` - (Optional) Enable MFA delete for either `Change the versioning state of your bucket` or
  `Permanently delete an object version`. Default is `false`.

The `logging` object supports the following:

* `target_bucket` - (Required) The name of the bucket that will receive the log objects.

* `target_prefix` - (Optional) To specify a key prefix for log objects.

The `lifecycle_rule` object supports the following:

* `id` - (Optional) Unique identifier for the rule.

* `prefix` - (Optional) Object key prefix identifying one or more objects to which the rule applies.

* `enabled` - (Required) Specifies lifecycle rule status.

* `abort_incomplete_multipart_upload_days` - (Optional) Specifies the number of days after initiating
  a multipart upload when the multipart upload must be completed.

* `expiration` - (Optional) Specifies a period in the object's expire (documented below).

* `noncurrent_version_expiration` - (Optional) Specifies when noncurrent object versions expire (documented below).

At least one of `expiration`, `noncurrent_version_expiration` must be specified.

The `expiration` object supports the following

* `date` - (Optional) Specifies the date after which you want the corresponding action to take effect.

* `days` - (Optional) Specifies the number of days after object creation when the specific rule action takes effect.

* `expired_object_delete_marker` - (Optional) On a versioned bucket (versioning-enabled or versioning-suspended bucket),
  you can add this element in the lifecycle configuration to direct Amazon S3 to delete expired object delete markers.

The `noncurrent_version_expiration` object supports the following:

* `days` - (Required) Specifies the number of days an object is noncurrent object versions expire.

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `id` - The name of the bucket.

* `arn` - The ARN of the bucket. Will be of format `arn:aws:s3:::bucketname`.

* `bucket_domain_name` - The bucket domain name. Will be of format `bucketname.s3.amazonaws.com`.

* `hosted_zone_id` - The [Route 53 Hosted Zone ID](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#s3_website_region_endpoints)
