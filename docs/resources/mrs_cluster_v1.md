  `MRS 1.7.0`, `MRS 1.9.2`, `MRS 2.1.0`, `MRS 3.0.2` are supported. The latest
  version of MRS is used by default.

* `cluster_type` - (Optional) Type of clusters `0`: analysis cluster, `1`: streaming

  in the OBS system. Costs of clusters are relatively low but computing performance
  is poor. The clusters can be deleted at any time. It is recommended when data
  computing is not frequently performed. Integration of data storage and computing:
  Data is stored in the HDFS system. Costs of clusters are relatively high but

  provided by the cluster. `1`: safe mode. The value indicates that the Kerberos
  authentication is enabled. Common users cannot use the file management or job
  management functions of an MRS cluster and cannot view cluster resource usage
  or the job records of Hadoop and Spark. To use these functions, the users must
  obtain the relevant permissions from the MRS Manager administrator. The request
  has the `cluster_admin_secret` parameter only when `safe_mode` is set to `1`.
